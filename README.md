## Steps to get the streamlit app up and running
- Open Colab notebook [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nEQmJ_mubz--Ttaj_1S2Yh0cnQqS3A5U?usp=sharing)
- Run all cells
- Click on the link generated in the last cell to access the streamlit app. You will be prompted to enter `ip-address` (see picture below on where to find it)

- Upload a pdf file of your choice and ask questions you may have
- Note that the current model in use is not very accurate. More work is needed to find a better model that gives better results, without crashing colab notebook
- It takes a few seconds for the streamlit app to generate the response. Configure colab notebooks to a GPU runtime to yield a faster response.
